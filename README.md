# Diego's Game

## About the Game

### Our Goal

When tasked with creating an interactive program, we jumped on the idea of it being a game. Now, with the current knowledge and resources we decided that a simple top down shooter type game would be a fun challenge for us to take on. Our goal was to create a controllable character that could fire projectiles at targets that spawn around the map. In the end, we were able to reach our goal and even add a few features we came up with along the way.
